<!-- Since 2008, I have received hands-on-training to capture and band passerines and near passerines, blackbirds, woodpeckers, flycatchers, sparrows, and owls while adhering to strict capture and handling protocols. I have also been trained in a variety of additional authorizations including color marking, blood, feather and claw sampling, and attaching geolocators and radio transmitters. Personnel I have trained with include Dr. Julie Heath (Boise State University), Dr. Steve Ackers (Oregon State University), Dr. Kenneth Schmidt (Texas Tech University), and Jessica Bolser and Adam Smith (University of Rhode Island). -->
